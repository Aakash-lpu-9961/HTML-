These planets have broadly been classified into two categories that are inner planets and outer planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are called inner planets. The inner planets are closer to the Sun and they are smaller in size as compared to the outer planets. These are also referred to as the Terrestrial planets. And the other four Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are termed as the outer planets. These four are massive in size and are often referred to as Giant planets.</i></b></font></p>

The larger an object is, the more gravity it has. Because the Sun is so large, its powerful gravity attracts all the other objects in the Solar System towards it. At the same time, these objects, which are moving very rapidly, try to fly away from the Sun, outward into the emptiness of outer space.

The result of the planets trying to fly away, at the same time that the Sun is trying to pull them inward is that they become trapped half-way in between. Balanced between flying towards the Sun and escaping into space, they spend eternity orbiting around their parent star.

The Planets orbit in the same direction (counter-clockwise looking down from above the Sun’s North Pole); all but Venus, Uranus and Pluto also rotate in that same sense. Mercury has the fastest elliptical orbit,</i></b></font></p>

Whereas the orbit of most planets has the shape of a circle, the Mercury’s orbit has the shape of ellipse that looks like a stretched out circle. For that reason, the distance from Mercury to the sun varies from about 27 to 41 million miles. Mercury races around the sun faster than any other planet. A Mercurial year accounts only for 88 days, while our year on Earth comprises 365 days that is four times longer than of the Mercurial. We all know that it takes 24 hours or one day for Earth to make one complete rotation around its axis. For Mercury to make the same complete rotation, it will take as many as 59 Earth days!</i></b></font></p>

If you look at the model of Mercury, you will see many craters on its surface. The planet has been hit many times throughout its existence by asteroids and other flying objects. Those impacts resulted in a plenty of craters covering its surface. It is believed that likewise craters had covered all Earth at one time in the past. However, due to the erosion of soils, extremely changeable weather, and climate conditions, those craters had been leveled off.

Mercury has some interesting characteristics that make it unique. It is the closest planet to the sun, has ellipse orbit, resolves around the sun faster than any other planet, rotates very slowly, has the greatest temperature change, and almost no air. Also, those facts prove that life is impossible on Mercury.</i></b></font></p>

Space.com. Web. 30 Apr. 2014) Venus has fewer impact craters than any other planet. Also unlike most planets, Venus turns clockwise on its axis, as opposed to counter-clockwise. This is called retrograde rotation. It is said that this is because of their close position to the Sun. Appearing to be a nice golden color, the pictures we see of Venus is actually showing the clouds that are filled with sulfuric acid, making its atmosphere cloudy and dense. A year on Venus last 225 Earth days and a day lasts 243 Earth days. This means that it takes longer for Venus to spin on its axis, than it does for it to orbit the Sun. Another interesting thing about Venus is that its orbit is most nearly circular than any other planet, at a speed of 108, 209, 475 kilometers. The diameter is also almost nearly circular. Scientists think that the runaway greenhouse effect that Venus is impacted by boiled away its oceans long ago, but it is still known for indications of volcanic activity, which probably stopped many years …show more content…
Scientists believe that at one time Venus had a moon. They believe that it was “slammed” early, and a piece of it was possibly a moon that drifted away. However, Venus does interact with our moon. Venus appears to be nearby our moon in the night sky and is the brightest object in the night sky besides our moon. It’s so bright that it’s known as the “Morning Star” and “Evening Star”, because it can be seen at night and occasionally during the day. It also interacts with Earth a good bit.

Not only that, but the harsh condition of its atmosphere which is ninety-two that of Earth, and full of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide, make human life virtually impossible. However, some researchers believe some sort of life may be somehow possible. The surface of Venus is extremely dry, according to radar maps, but there is a possibility of small sulfur lakes and rivers so shallow, they have been missed. If there was life on Venus, it would definitely not be humans. Life would have to be something heavier, more durable, and used to living under an extremely hot pressure. Scientists also seem to believe that life may have existed on Venus more than a million years ago. There has not been any sign of water on Venus for about 600 million years, and they believe this is caused by the runaway greenhouse effect that makes the planet so hot and humid. Before the runaway greenhouse effect took over Venus, there was a possibility of oceans and cloud filled with water vapor. Because it has been so long since water possibly existed, Venus is the now a dry, hot planet and Earth’s harsh sister

The possibility of life on mars has aroused the interest of scientists for many years. A major reason for this interest is due to the similarity and proximity of the planet to Earth. Mars certainly gives some indications of the possibility of life.</i></b></font></p>

<p><font color="black" size="6"><b><i>  In the past, Mars used to look quite similar to Earth. Billions of years ago, there were certainly similarities between Mars and Earth. Furthermore, scientists believe that Mars once had a huge ocean. This ocean, experts believe, covered more of the planet’s surface than Earth’s own oceans do so currently.

Moreover, Mars was much warmer in the past that it is currently. Most noteworthy, warm temperature and water are two major requirements for life to exist. So, there is a high probability that previously there was life on Mars.

Life on Earth can exist in the harshest of circumstances. Furthermore, life exists in the most extreme places on Earth. Moreover, life on Earth is available in the extremely hot and dry deserts. Also, life exists in the extremely cold Antarctica continent. Most noteworthy, this resilience of life gives plenty of hope about life on Mars.

There are some ingredients for life that already exist on Mars. Bio signatures refer to current and past life markers. Furthermore, scientists are scouring the surface for them. Moreover, there has been an emergence of a few promising leads. One notable example is the presence of methane in Mars’s atmosphere. Most noteworthy, scientists have no idea where the methane is coming from. Therefore, a possibility arises that methane presence is due to microbes existing deep below the planet’s surface.

One important point to note is that no scratching of Mars’s surface has taken place. Furthermore, a couple of inches of scratching has taken place until now. Scientists have undertaken analysis of small pinches of soil. There may also have been a failure to detect signs of life due to the use of faulty techniques. Most noteworthy, there may be “refugee life” deep below the planet’s surface.</i></b></font></p>

<p><font color="black" size="6"><b><i>The knowledge of what the inner core is made up is still and will remain unknown until we can create a satellite that can make into the atmosphere of Jupiter and the other gas planets. Jupiter's atmosphere was also found to be quite turbulent. It is also know that Jupiter spins faster than any other planet. This indicates that Jupiter's winds are driven in large part by its internal heat rather than from solar input as on Earth. The vivid colors seen in Jupiter's clouds are probably the result of subtle chemical reactions of the trace elements in Jupiter's atmosphere, perhaps involving sulfur whose compounds take on a wide variety of colors, but the details are unknown. The colors correlate with the cloud's altitude: blue lowest, followed by browns and whites, with reds highest. Sometimes we see the lower layers through holes in the upper ones. Then we have the Great Red Spot that everyone can identify as Jupiter. This reddish color of the “Great Red Spot” is a puzzle to scientist, but several chemicals, including phosphorus, have been proposed as a reason. In fact, the color and mechanisms driving the appearance of the entire atmosphere are still not well understood. This spot has been seen by Earthly observers for more than 300 years. Robert Hooke discovered it in the 17th century. The GRS is an oval about 12,000 by 25,000 km, big enough to hold two Earths.

The gas giant is 72 thousand miles in diameter, almost ten times the size of Earth.  In spite of its huge size, though, Saturn weighs very little.  It is a very light gas planet.  Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system-- so light, in fact, that it would float in water.  This planet is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter, but it is much less dense.  The combination of its light weight and fast rotation causes Saturn to spread out, or oblate, its center.  Since Saturn is a gas planet, it does not have a solid surface.  Spacecraft are unable to land on this type of surface.  The clouds that are seen when looking at Saturn are just the top layer of a very deep layer that covers a center of liquid hydrogen.  The clouds are blown by constant winds that reach speeds up to one thousand miles per hour at the equator of the planet (“Great Space Place”).  </i></b></font></p>

This apparent backward motion is created when the orbit of the Earth takes it past an outer planet. Since Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[21] In July 2009 University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the star he had observed had moved relative to the fixed  </i></b></font></p>
